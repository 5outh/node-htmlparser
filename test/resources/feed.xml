If there is one place on my body that shows more age than any other, including my face, it is my hands. So what do I think? Well, I'm loving it so far. My hands no longer have a dried, cracked look but instead my skin is noticeably softer and more pliable. I'm also seeing a lightening of my age spots that have come out of nowhere in the last few years. Granted it is winter, but I can't remember ever thinking in past winters that these age spots are going away. I love that Foxbrim uses organic ingredients. Since our skin is like a sponge when it comes to absorption, I am comforted in knowing that I'm not rubbing chemicals into my body. Thank you for a quality product.</div> <div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both; width: 100%;"> </div></div>
